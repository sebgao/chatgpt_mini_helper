## Dependencies

In order to run this program, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- openai==0.27

## Usage

To run the ChatGPT program, run the script `chatgpt.py` in your Python environment. The program reads user input from standard input.

When the program is running, you can enter a message, and the program will respond with an appropriate message generated by the OpenAI language model. The program can read PDFs and different file formats in response to specific keywords.

The following are some special features in the program that can be used:

- `exit`: Exits the program
- `-1`: Deletes the previous message
- `clear`: Clears the chat history
- `save`: Saves the chat history to a file
- `load`: Loads the chat history from a file

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the pip commands as described above.
2. Run the `chatgpt.py` script in your Python environment with `OPENAI_APIKEY` environment variable.
3. Enter a message in the prompt and press enter.
4. The program will respond with a message generated by the OpenAI language model.
5. Use the special features listed above to modify the chat history, save it to a file, or load it from a file.
6. To exit the program, enter "exit" at the prompt.

Note:
1. The program can read PDFs and different file formats in response to specific keywords. To use this feature, enter the keyword followed by the file name in curly braces, for example `p{sample.pdf}` to parse the text from a PDF file named "sample.pdf".
2. The program has a history of the conversation that is limited to the last 10 messages.
3. The program can handle keyboard interrupts gracefully. If you hit Ctrl-C while waiting for the GPT-3.5 model to respond, the program will not crash.
