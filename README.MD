## How to use

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Set the `OPENAI_APIKEY` environment variable.
3. Open the terminal in the repository directory.
4. Run the program by executing the following command:

   ```
   python chatgpt.py
   ```

5. Once the program starts, enter a message and press Enter. The program will respond with a message generated by the GPT-3.5 model.
6. The program includes the following special features:
   - `exit`: Exits the program.
   - `-1`: Deletes the previous message.
   - `clear`: Clears the chat history.
   - `save`: Saves the chat history to a file.
   - `load`: Loads the chat history from a file.
   - To involve the text of a PDF, enter `p{filename}` in your message. The program will parse the PDF, correct the text using the GPT-3.5 model, and replace `p{filename}` with the corrected text. Note that this functionality is limited to the first two pages of the PDF file.
   - To replace a filename with its contents, use `{filename}` in your message. The program will replace each occurrence of `{filename}` with the contents of the corresponding file.
