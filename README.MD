# Usage Document
`This document is first generated by GPT 3.5 API and then revised by me.`

## Dependencies

To run this program, please make sure you have the following packages installed in your Python environment:

- openai==0.27
- pypdf2

You can install these packages by running the following pip commands:

```
$ pip install openai==0.27
$ pip install pypdf2
```

## How to use
1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Set `OPENAI_APIKEY` environment variable.
3. Open the terminal in the repository directory.
4. Run the program by executing the following command:
```
python chatgpt.py
``` 
5. Once the program starts, enter a message and press enter. The program will respond with a message generated by the GPT-3.5 model.
6. The following are some special features in the program you can use:
   - `exit`: Exits the program
   - `-1`: Deletes the previous message
   - `clear`: Clears the chat history
   - `save`: Saves the chat history to a file
   - `load`: Loads the chat history from a file
   - To involve the text of a PDF, enter `p{filename}` in your message. The program will parse the PDF (only two first pages), correct the text using the GPT-3.5 model, and replace `p{filename}` with the corrected text.
   - To replace a filename with its content, use `{filename}` in your message. The program will replace each occurrence of `{filename}` with the contents of the corresponding file.
7. Follow the prompts provided by the program to proceed with the conversation.
8. To exit the program, enter "exit" at the prompt.

### Note:
- The program has a history of the conversation that is limited to the last 10 messages.
- The program can handle keyboard interrupts gracefully. If you hit Ctrl-C while waiting for the GPT-3.5 model to respond, the program will not crash
